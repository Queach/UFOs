# UFO sightings

## Overview of Project
Using javascript and html to create a webpage that displays and filters data on UFO's

## Analysis and Results
To use this webpage one most simply enter data into the search boxes on the left hand side, when new data is entered into any of the boxes, the data in the right table will
be instantly filtered for the user to see.

## Summary
One drawback to the new website design is that it is less intuitive to user on how it works
To continue to develop the website it is recommended that the website draws data from a live database so users always have new data to look through.
Along with adding a page for users to enter their own ufo sightings to that database. These 2 additions would add life and dynamic content to the webstie.
