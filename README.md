## Summary
One drawback to the new website design is that it is less intuitive to user on how it works
To continue to develop the website it is recommended that the website draws data from a live database so users always have new data to look through.
Along with adding a page for users to enter their own ufo sightings to that database. These 2 additions would add life and dynamic content to the webstie.
